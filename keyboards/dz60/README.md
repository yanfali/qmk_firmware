# DZ60 PCB from KBDFans

This is the PCB used in their Tina keyboard and available separately
for purchase as the DZ60.

This port is based on the XD60 with values changed to match those
from the JSON file from qmkeyboard.cn for the split space configuration.

As time permits I will be porting the other Tina configurations,
but I only have a keyboard with the split configuration so testing
my be haphazard.
